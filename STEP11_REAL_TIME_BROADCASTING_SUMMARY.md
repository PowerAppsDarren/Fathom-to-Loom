# Step 11: Real-time Queue Broadcasting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented real-time queue broadcasting using `tokio::sync::broadcast` and Axum WebSocket handler. The system now broadcasts queue changes between backend API and worker processes, with filtering by user_id and global position.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Shared Broadcast Service (`common/src/broadcast.rs`)
- Created `BroadcastService` using `tokio::sync::broadcast`
- Supports multiple event types: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, TaskFailed, TaskRetried, PositionUpdated, QueueCleared
- Includes user filtering via `affected_user_id` and position tracking via `global_position`
- Thread-safe with Arc wrapper for sharing between processes

### 2. Enhanced WebSocket Manager (`backend/src/api/websocket.rs`)
- Updated `QueueUpdate` structure to include `affected_user_id` and `global_position`
- Added user authentication via query parameters (`user_id`, `token`)
- Implemented client-side filtering logic:
  - User-specific updates sent only to affected user or admin
  - Global position updates sent to all clients
  - Admin users see all updates
- Integrated with external broadcast service for worker communication

### 3. Queue Operations Broadcasting (`backend/src/api/queue.rs`)
- Queue add/remove operations now emit broadcast events
- Events include user context and position information
- Proper async handling to avoid blocking queue operations

### 4. Worker Integration (`worker/src/queue.rs`)
- Worker processes now emit events when tasks change status
- Integration with shared broadcast service
- Events include task lifecycle: started, completed, failed, retry

### 5. Backend Integration (`backend/src/main.rs`)
- Initialized shared broadcast service factory
- WebSocket manager configured with external broadcast integration
- Cross-process communication established

## Architecture Flow

```
Worker Process -> Shared Broadcast Service -> Backend WebSocket Manager -> Connected Clients
     |                                                                           ^
     |                                                                           |
     +-> Queue Status Changes                                        User-filtered updates
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Updates
- Queue changes broadcast immediately to connected WebSocket clients
- Worker task status changes propagated in real-time
- Position updates when queue order changes

### User Filtering
- Users only receive updates relevant to their tasks (when `affected_user_id` matches)
- Global queue position updates sent to all users
- Admin users receive all updates for monitoring

### Position Tracking
- Global queue position included in updates
- Automatic position recalculation when items are removed
- Queue reordering events broadcast to all clients

### Scalability
- `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel with configurable capacity (1000 events)
- Non-blocking operation - queue operations don't wait for broadcast delivery
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected WebSocket clients

## WebSocket Client Connection

Clients connect with optional user authentication:
```
ws://localhost:8080/queue_updates?user_id=user123
ws://localhost:8080/queue_updates?token=auth_token_here
```

## Message Format

WebSocket messages follow this structure:
```json
{
  "type": "QueueUpdate",
  "update_type": "meeting_added|meeting_removed|position_updated|queue_cleared",
  "queue": [...],
  "affected_user_id": "user123",
  "global_position": 5,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling
- Broadcast errors logged but don't block operations
- WebSocket connection cleanup on client disconnect
- Graceful handling of lagged clients (skip old updates)

## Testing Status
- Backend compiles successfully with warnings (unused imports/variables)
- Worker compiles successfully with warnings
- Ready for integration testing with frontend WebSocket client

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Connect frontend WebSocket client to `/queue_updates` endpoint
2. Add queue items via API and verify real-time updates
3. Start worker process and verify task status broadcasts
4. Test user filtering by connecting multiple clients with different user_ids

## Performance Considerations
- Channel capacity set to 1000 events (configurable)
- Automatic client disconnection cleanup
- Non-blocking broadcast operations
- Efficient filtering at the WebSocket level

This implementation provides a robust foundation for real-time queue monitoring and updates across the entire Fathom-to-Loom system.
